# What is this?

Godot build and publish is an application developed by me (Nick), which will automate the process of building and publishing your Godot games to itch.io.

While testing and bugfixing, making new builds and then uploading them to itch.io can be a pain, so with the use of the Godot API and Butler, I created this quick little batch tool!

# Setup

## Configure the script

Firstly, you will need to navigate to the config.bat file, and input the appropriate filepaths for each parameter

This is important, or the script will not run!

# Running the script

In order to run the script, in a terminal, run "godot_build_and_publish.bat {your_game_name}"

Ensure that your game's name is the proper name on itch! (as a note, itch typically uses '-' characters in-place of your spaces internally!)
